1. Preface
-----------

As staple is a framework for diskless boot management, the installation process
is different for each distribution/system/network configuration. This file will
give the necessary instruction for general installations, with examples from
debian.

This document explain only the basic installation process of staple. It does
not explain the staple operation or how to configure it, nor how to boot a
diskless machine.

You should already be familiar with your system boot process in order to
properly install staple. For more information you should look at your system
manual or the init(8) or rc(8) man pages (and/or others, depending on you
system).


2. Download
------------

Currently the only way to download is through svn. For the latest development:

  svn checkout http://stapleboot.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ /path/to/download 

or for specific version:

  svn checkout http://stapleboot.googlecode.com/svn/tags/<version> /path/to/download 


3. File System
---------------

Staple installation consists of several directories:

3.1: The binary directory

This is where the staple binaries and libraries are. It could be on the root
filesystem (distribution) itself or mounted at boot from a network
filesystem. The bin and the lib directories from the download should be placed
there. As staple is currently perl based, the lib and bin directories can be
separated as long as the PERL5LIB environment variable is set up correctly.

3.2: The database directory

This is where the staple configurations are. This is only relevant when staple
is configured to use filesystem as a database (as opposed to SQL). This
directory should probably be a network filesystem and not part of the
distribution, as it contain configuration for other distributions as well. It
can be the same directory as the binaries. The default is /boot/staple.

3.3: The stapleboot configurations

/etc/staple/ contains initial configurations for the stapleboot. There are two
files read directly by staple: 'distribution' which contains a single line
naming the distribution; and 'staple.conf', which is an old style staple token
file with initial tokens for staple.

This directory can also be used for distribution specific binaries/scripts,
such as the fine lable script, or a mount script.


4. Installing
--------------

Copy the bin and lib directories to the binary directory (either network or
distribution). 

Copy misc/staple.conf to /etc/staple/staple.conf as an initial configuration
(and change it appropriately if needed).

Create /etc/staple/distribution with the distribution name (arbitrary name, try
to avoid weird letters or spaces).

5. Configuring Boot
--------------------

The main staple program that runs on boot is 'stapleboot'. This program is
basically a wrapper for the default sysinit scripts and as such, should be run
instead of them. Usually there's a simple script that mounts the necessary
directories and then runs stapleboot.

On SysV like init, stapleboot should be run in the sysinit entry or
/etc/inittab, e.g.: 

si::sysinit:/etc/rcS.staple

An example of an /etc/rcS.staple script is available in the misc directory.
This example mounts $staplesrc (received from the dhcp as a kernel parameter,
or manually set on the script), which is considered the binary and
configuration directories, and runs stapleboot.


6. Dependencies
----------------

Staple requires several perl packages that should be installed either directly
on the distribution, or in the lib directory of staple. The simplest way to
figure out what the dependencies are (until a proper list is conjured) is to cd
into the bin directory and run stapleboot, stapler and staplectl (*NOT* as
root). Perl will complain about its missing packages. When perl finishes to
complain, staple will complain that it is not configured properly (or that it
is not root).


7. Staple Initial Configuration
--------------------------------

In order for the stapleboot to work, even without doing anything, two things
must be configured in the staple: the host and the distribution.

start staplectl from the bin directory. If it's on a machine that booted from
staple, it should find the database automatically. If not (obviously for the
first run), it should be set either with the --db parameter:

staplectl --db="fs /some/dir/probably/network/stapledb/"

or from within staple:

staplectl> setdb fs /some/dir/probably/network/stapledb/

To initialize a completely new database:

staplectl> newdb fs /some/dir/probably/network/stapledb/

Then, add the distribution and the host:

staplectl> adddistribution <dist-name>
staplectl> addhost <host-name>

Where <dist-name> is the string in /etc/staple/distribution, and <host-name> is
the host as received from "hostname" (or, rather, perl's Sys::Hostname
package).
