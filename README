Staple is a framework for diskless boot management. Its purpose is to simplify
the configuration of machines that boot from the same root filesystem but might
need a different set of applications/configurations.

Staple itself is a collection of perl scripts and modules, that at boot
identifies the machine and the root filesystem and apply the appropriate
configurations accordingly. Configurations can be mounting disks, copying
templates, or running scripts. 

Please check the MANUAL file for usage information.
